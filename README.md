# Bag of Tricks for Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks 


This repo was inspired by Paper [Bag of Tricks for Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01187)

I would test popular training tricks as many as I can for improving image classification accuarcy, feel
free to leave a comment about the tricks you want me to test(please write the referenced paper along with
the tricks)

## hardware
Using 4 Tesla P40 to run the experiments

## dataset

I will use [CUB_200_2011](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html) dataset instead of ImageNet,
just for simplicity, this is a fine-grained image classification dataset, which contains 200 birds categlories, 
5K+ training images, and 5K+ test images.The state of the art acc on vgg16 is around 73%(please correct me if 
I was wrong).You could easily change it to the ones you like: [Stanford Dogs](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/), [Stanford Cars](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/).
Or even ImageNet.

## network

Use a VGG16 network to test my tricks, also for simplicity reasons, since VGG16 is easy to implement. I'm considering
switch to AlexNet, to see how powerful these tricks are.

## tricks

tricks I've tested, some of them were from the Paper [Bag of Tricks for Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01187) :

## result

baseline(training from sctrach, no ImageNet pretrain weights are used):
